# Cricket Data Analytics Project
**Web Scraping | Python | Pandas | Power Bi**

## Introduction 
This project aims to perform an end-to-end data analysis on T20 international cricket players. The primary goal was to automate the collection of player statistics from web sources, process and clean the data, and build an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard facilitates the strategic selection of players for a hypothetical "Final 11" team based on their performance metrics, categorized by their playing roles (Power hitters, Anchor, Finisher, All-rounder, Specialist Fast Bowlers).
